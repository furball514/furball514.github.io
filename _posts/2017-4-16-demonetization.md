# Demonetization: Can this help with our currency in the hands of the government?

On 8 November 2016, the Government of India announced the demonetisation of all ₹500 and ₹1,000 banknotes of the Mahatma Gandhi Series.The government claimed that the action would curtail the shadow economy and crack down on the use of illicit and counterfeit cash to fund illegal activity and terrorism.The sudden nature of the announcement—and the prolonged cash shortages in the weeks that followed—created significant disruption throughout the economy, threatening economic output.The move was heavily criticised as poorly planned and unfair, and was met with protests, litigation, and strikes.

This proves that the government can demonetize a particular currency without fear of backlash .
At any moment, much of our earnings can be rendered useless with the wish of just a few people.

>  Entry No 36 of Union List in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution authorizes the Union government to exercise executive power in respect of currency, coinage, legal tender and foreign exchange. It is now well established that for the exercise of the executive power authorized by the entry in the relevant List, it is not necessary that there should be a prior legislation.

## **A solution?**

Although this demonetization may have had some impact on the problems that governments are hoping to solve, like the circulation of counterfeit money, tax evasion, and corruption, these measures affect regular citizens the most. A large portion of these are left with useless bills to exchange and no way to access basic goods and services, which results in economic disaster and general confusion within the country.

The drastic steps taken to force the population into funnelling all of their financial transactions through the banks makes the use of cryptocurrencies extremely attractive, which can be observed in the trading volume in both India and Pakistan.

## **What is a crypto currency?**

> a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.

Although Bitcoin is the most well-known and easy to acquire cryptocurrency, citizens may soon shift their focus to a more privacy-driven cryptocurrency such as Monero, which allows users to conceal values and other identifying information on their transactions.

Monero provides anonymous transactions by using ring signatures, where transactions on the blockchain are mixed. 

Its decentralized nature will pose a challenge for those who seek to further eliminate privacy and impose financial control on the population.

## **What is Monero?**

According to the Monero website,

>“Monero is a secure, private, untraceable currency.” 

Some people might think that this definition could be applied to Bitcoin but that is actually not the case when it comes to being private and untraceable. Monero is a digital currency that uses a different kind of cryptography to allow for these specific attributes. 

There is a common misconception that Bitcoin is entirely untraceable digital money. The very premise of Bitcoin is that all transactions can be viewed on a public ledger called the blockchain. This is useful because it allows anyone to verify that a transaction occurred, particularly for ones that need to be completely transparent (e.g. government, non-profit spending).

Monero is different than Bitcoin in that it focuses on the privacy aspect of transacting with a digital currency. Monero uses a different type of technology to make the transactions untraceable and the balances hidden. 

Monero is more private than Bitcoin, because it uses an opaque ledger instead of a transparent ledger. It is impossible to link or trace Monero transactions. Paper cash transactions also cannot be linked or traced. Therefore, Monero is more "cash-like" than Bitcoin.

Since cash is so commonly used in India, Bitcoin's transparency may be a barrier to adoption. People don't want to give up their privacy. They may be more willing to use a digital cash that guarantees privacy.

Without diving too deep into the technical details, the way Monero is able to make transactions untraceable is through a technology called ring signatures. It essentially mixes an individual’s set of transactions with others so it is not clear to the public eye who owns which addresses. It also hides balances through stealth addresses which are random one time addresses that can’t be associated with an individual publicly.

In the US, the main Monero exchanges are: [Poloniex](http://poloniex.com) and [Bittrex](http://bittrex.com).
